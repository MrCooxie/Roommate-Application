# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the team! Here are some guidelines for collaborating on the Roommate Application.

## GitHub Workflow

1. **Branching Strategy**:
   - `main`: Production-ready code.
   - `develop`: Integration branch for features.
   - `feature/feature-name`: Individual feature branches.
   - `bugfix/issue-name`: Fixes for specific bugs.

2. **Pull Requests**:
   - Create a PR from your feature branch to `develop`.
   - Ensure your code passes all linting and tests.
   - Request at least one review from another team member.

3. **Commit Messages**:
   - Use descriptive commit messages (e.g., `feat: add user login`, `fix: resolve CORS issue`).
   - Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) if possible.

## Coding Standards

- **Frontend**: Follow React best practices, use TypeScript for new components.
- **Backend**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code.

## Communication

- Use GitHub Issues for tracking tasks and bugs.
- Discussion can happen within PR comments or our team chat.
